# joomla-hs-users
modified version of hs_users component for joomla

I modified/hacked this becuase it did not work properly for me.

1. facebook permissions require app approval. so the scope has been reduced
2. error messages do not contain facebook error description so added logging.
3. origional logging option crashes the app altogether
4. https issue (is really a joomla issue)
